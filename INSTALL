Installation guide for Halibut
==============================

This file is a guide to building and installing the documentation
utility `Halibut' from its source archive.

If you are reading this, then you have probably already unpacked the
source archive somewhere.

Building Halibut
----------------

Halibut is built using CMake <https://cmake.org/>. To compile in the
simplest way (on any of Linux, Windows or Mac), run these commands in
the source directory:

  cmake .
  cmake --build .

(You'll also need to have a C compiler and some kind of build tool
installed, such as gcc and make.)

Halibut's source files are intended to be almost entirely portable
ANSI C. If they fail to compile and run correctly on your compiler,
this might very well be considered a bug.

Installing Halibut
------------------

Halibut requires no additional data files. Simply install the
binary, man page and full documentation in appropriate places for
your system.
